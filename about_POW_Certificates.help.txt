SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Describes how to create https certificates and bind them to a certain port.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	In order to serve https requests, a certificate with a private key must be associated
	with the port the server is listening to.

	To bind a certificate to a port, first you must have a certificate.
	Certificates are stored in so-called Certificate Stores, and are accessible in Powershell using the cert: provider.

		PS> cd cert:\
		PS Cert:\> dir -Recurse

	That command will list all stores and certificates available in your machine and for the current user.
	You can use the cert: provider and the cmdlet Get-ChildItem to select the desired certificate for binding.
	However, writing filters and where clauses to do that can become too complicated. Because of this,
	we provide a convenient function Select-Certificate that does that job in a less cumbersome way.

		To learn more:
		Get-Help Select-Certificate

	The certificate selected for binding must have a private key and have its subject set to the dns name of your website.
	In case there are no suitable certificates, you have to create one yourself. The easiest way to do that
	is by creating a self-signed certificate. Powershell provides the cmdlet New-SelfSignedCertificate for that
	purpose, and altough is it fairly straightforward to use, we also provide a convenient wrapper around it.
	That is New-HttpsCertificate, and it already selects the correct key store, key algorithm and key length for your certificate.

		To learn more:
		Get-Help New-HttpsCertificate
		Get-Help New-SelfSignedCertificate

	The certificate created by New-HttpsCertificate contains an unprotected private key. Remember only to use it for
	test purposes inside of trusted networks.

	After you have created/selected the certificate, it is time to bind it to the desired port.
	There are two parameters important for this task. One is the port itself, and it must be the port
	that your server will listen to. The other is the ip address corresponding to the interface that will
	receive the requests for your server to respond. It can be either a physical ip address, or 0.0.0.0,
	meaning that requests from all interfaces are valid.

	The binding can be done using the windows tool 'netsh', but we provide some convenient cmdlets for that task.
	First there is New-HttpsCertificateBinding, used to create the binding. Without parameters, it binds to 0.0.0.0:8443,
	that port being the default https port of the POW server. It takes a mandatory parameter 'Certificate', which can be
	the output from Select-Certificate and cand be fed in using powershell's pipeline.

	Then, there is Remove-HttpsCertificateBinding, used to remove a certaing binding. To remove a binding,
	the only information needed are the ip and port.

	Last, there is Get-HttpsCertificateBinding, used to check if a binding to the desired ip:port already exists.
